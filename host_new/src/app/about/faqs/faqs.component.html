               <p>World Vision India is a Christian grassroots humanitarian organisation that reaches out to the poorest of the poor in India regardless of caste, creed, race or religion. Through development, relief and advocacy, World Vision India strives to create lasting change in the lives of children, their families and communities living in contexts of poverty and injustice. World Vision started as a small organisation when its founder Bob Pierce, a war correspondent, began helping children affected by the Korean War in 1947. Today, World Vision works in about 100 countries worldwide, enriching the lives of over 1.5 crore children. World Vision India is governed by an independent Board with men and women drawn from different parts of the country and from different disciplines. World Vision International has consultative status with UN/ECOSOC (Category III) and is in official relationship with UN agencies, including UNICEF, WHO, UNHCR and ILO.</p>

                <p>World Vision India seeks to ensure the sustained well-being of all children living in poverty. Well-being for children is measured in terms of access to basic health care and appropriate education, children feeling protected and cared for and having opportunities to participate. While we measure the impact of our work in terms of the child, the investments are also into families and communities. World Vision India's investment into families and communities is to ensure that the well-being of children is sustained even after World Vision India leaves the area. Our experience over the years has shown that if we limit our programmes and investment to just directly impact the child, the change will not be sustainable. For sustaining the well-being of children, we need to equip the families and communities socio-economically; hence, World Vision India's approach to child well-being is community-based and involves multiple programmes. World Vision India's investment in children, their families and communities are often in areas such as economic development, education, health and leadership development. We work closely with community-based organisations, government, other NGOs and civil societies. World Vision India recognises that sustaining the well-being of children also requires policy, structure and systems support. We work closely with the local, state and central government along with other NGOs and academic institutions. World Vision India also responds to natural disasters due to natural calamities in the country, especially to ensure children in these communities are protected and their families are provided adequate disaster risk reduction support to be rehabilitated in the short-term. World Vision India has responded to every major disaster, starting from the cyclone in Machilipatnam, Andhra Pradesh, in 1977, tsunami in 2004, Uttarakhand floods in 2013 to the most recent Ockhi cyclone in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. </p>

                <p>World Vision's work in India began in the year 1958 in a small way in Kolkata. Today, as the country's largest grassroots child-focused organisation, almost 1600 staff work in over 6252 communities, touching the lives of a little over 26 lakh children, their families and communities, across 185 districts in 25 states and 1 National Capital Region World Vision India is a registered society under the Tamil Nadu Societies Act 1975, with its National Office in Chennai. We select areas where children live in most vulnerable situations, in consultation with government and other NGOs. In each of the districts, we select the most vulnerable blocks and work in a contiguous set of villages and hamlets/slums serving an average of 40,000 people. This model of development that covers a large area over a long-term basis multi-sectorally is referred to as Area Development Programme. In each of these areas, we begin our work with rigorous assessment phase and broad consultation with various stakeholders. Along with the local community leaders, we develop the long-term strategy and short-term designs for our work in the community. To facilitate the sustained well-being of children it could take anywhere from 12 to 15 years.</p>

                <p>Sponsorship is more than making a monthly gift to a child. Child Sponsorship is our way of taking care of our own citizens and building our own nation. We believe that this is an opportunity for all Indians to partner with us in this nation-building process. It is our way of letting children know that we care for them. Furthermore, your continuous support not only brings lasting change to a community but also gives you the joy and satisfaction of having made the difference. This is your chance to make a meaningful gift that will change the life of a child. </p>

                <p>No. World Vision India is not involved in conversions. While World Vision India is motivated by the love of God in Jesus Christ to serve people in need, World Vision India will never exploit the vulnerability of the poor for faith reasons. Furthermore, World Vision India serves the poor, irrespective of caste, creed, colour, gender or religion. World Vision India does not engage in offering inducements or pressures to change faith; for us this principle is a policy position.</p>

                <p>World Vision India is committed to the highest levels of stewardship of all its resources. Through systematic monitoring and evaluation of all its programmes, World Vision India constantly strives to improve the quality of its programmes. World Vision India has systematic financial audits (internal and external) of all its programmes. BSRR & Co. are our current external auditors. In addition to these annual reviews and audits, World Vision India maintains a high level of accountability to its key stakeholders starting from the communities that we work in, the government and our sponsors and donors. The Home Ministry and Income Tax Office regularly receive our reports and Audited Financial Statements along with all other required documents in compliance with the regulations of the Government of India. Total transparency in transactions with the government and our supporters is the norm in World Vision India. Furthermore, sponsors and donors may visit the child or children that they sponsor to see the impact their support is making in the lives of these children. Many sponsors have visited World Vision India’s projects to see for themselves that the money they donate gets there and is used wisely. Our sponsors receive a community newsletter each year, which reports on how sponsors' money is helping change people's lives. Our Annual Reviews contain the audited financial statements and are available here - https://www.worldvision.in/AboutUs/finances-accountability.aspx</p>
